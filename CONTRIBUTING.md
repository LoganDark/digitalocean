# Contributing

Right now, the only reason this branch is on GitHub is because I might not be
working on it for a while. I'll probably come back to it eventually, but for now
I think the best course of action is to put it up and encourage others to both
review my code and propose changes/new ideas.

You should be able to find your way around what needs looking at by looking for
`TODO`s, since I've sprinkled them around for my initial commit. The code isn't
too large right now either, so you could easily read over the entire codebase in
a few minutes or so.
